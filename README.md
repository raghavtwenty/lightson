### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Energy conservation 
<br><br><br>


### DESCRIPTON
Create an intelligent street lighting solution that automatically adjusts lighting levels based on time of day, weather conditions, <br>
and cloud cover to enhance efficiency and safety.
<br><br><br>


### INTRODUCTION
The Adaptive Street Lighting System is designed to optimize street lighting by leveraging real-time data on timing, weather, and cloud coverage. <br>
This innovative solution not only improves public safety by ensuring well-lit streets during low visibility conditions <br>
but also contributes to energy conservation by reducing unnecessary illumination. <br>
By integrating advanced sensors and smart controls, this system aims to provide a more responsive and efficient approach <br>
to street lighting, ultimately benefiting urban environments and their residents.
